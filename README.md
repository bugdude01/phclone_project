# Product Hunt Clone

## Clone of Product Hunter to show use of Django.

Hi guys, here's a neat little projct. The idea was to make a simple clone of a website called Product Hunt (http://www.producthunt.com) using
Python and Django to illustrate how easy it would be to build, use a small database, handle authentications etc.

Initially used to refresh myself on Python but also used to get to grips with Django 2. With Python 3 being used exclusively with Django 2 you
will need to have this installed in order for things to work correctly. 

Incidentally, Django 2 is super neat and routing, as always, is super simple but now we are no longer reliant on REGEX!! Apologies to those 
of you who are good with REGEX, I've always been irritated by it but now I'm not forced to use it; super cool.

Anyway, here's the details on how to set this up.
