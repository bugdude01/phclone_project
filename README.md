# Product Hunt Clone

## Clone of Product Hunt to show use of Python and Django.

Hi guys, here's a neat little projct. The idea was to make a simple clone of a website called Product Hunt (http://www.producthunt.com) using
Python and Django to illustrate how easy it would be to build, use a small database, handle authentications etc.

Initially used to refresh myself on Python but also used to get to grips with Django 2. With Python 3 being used exclusively with Django 2 you
will need to have this installed in order for things to work correctly. 

Incidentally, Django 2 is super neat and routing, as always, is super simple but now we are no longer reliant on REGEX!! Apologies to those 
of you who are good with REGEX, I've always been irritated by it but now I'm not forced to use it; super cool.

Anyway, here's the details on how to set this up.

# Geting Started

OK, first things first, this clone was written using Django 2 which means you will need to be using Python 3. Please ensure that you have Python 3 installed and that you have the ability to run Python 3 code. You can check on your command line or in oyur terminal by typing  `python --version` and seeing what is displayed. If you are unsure if you have Python 3 or not you can type `python3 --version` and if Python 3 is installed it will display which version you have. If you don't have Python 3 instsalled the best way to do this is by going to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on the download option for your operating system. Their website should auto detect which OS you are using (Windows / MacOS / Linux etc.) so just go ahead and download VERSION 3.whatever and install in the usual way.
